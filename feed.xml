        <title>Soda Can Earrings</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to 2015! Which everyone knows will be the year of funky fresh fashion according to Back to the Future II, right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sce-btf_thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fashion in BBF2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe not, but I recently saw a photo on Pinterest of a pair of earrings fashioned from an Arizona Tea can. The cherry blossom design is quite pretty. But I of course thought to myself, “I can do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only soda cans in my home happen to be Surge and Bawls. The nerdiest, techiest of drinks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got my tools out and started cutting open the cans and cutting out designs using (so far) 2 techniques. I made 3 different types of earrings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/sce-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sce-1_thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Finished Surge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/sce-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sce-2_thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Finished Bawls&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took some tutorial pictures showing the first pair I made, so you can make your own! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a soda can&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sharp scissors (I used kitchen shears) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an exacto knife&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a design hole puncher (The only one I have right now is a 1” circle)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a small hole puncher (mine is ‘bead landing’ brand) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a couple jewelry tools (Probably also bead landing. They have everything.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an emery board (or sand paper)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some earring parts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and a surface you’re ok with cutting into. (I used some plywood)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/sce-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sce-3_thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tools1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/sce-4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sce-4_thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tools2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/sce-5.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sce-5_thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tools2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First step is to cut apart the can. Be careful because the can will most likely become very jagged. Cut one end off, then make a slit down the can away from any parts you might make into an earring, then cut the other end off. Cut off any jagged pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/sce-6.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sce-6_thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cutting Can1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/sce-7.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sce-7_thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cutting Can2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/sce-8.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sce-8_thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cutting Can3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might want to find something heavy to hold down the can as it will keep its roundedness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;right&quot; href=&quot;/assets/images/sce-9.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sce-9_thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next you want to cut out a design for the earring. I used the exacto knife to cut out some rectangles. I haven’t gotten adventurous yet. For the Bawls can I used the 1” hole punch for both earrings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you slice you can usually just peel the aluminum apart. You don’t necessarily have to cut all the way through with the knife. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;left&quot; href=&quot;/assets/images/sce-11.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sce-11_thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll want to use the emery board or sandpaper on the corners and perhaps on the edges a bit. The last thing you want is to be constantly poked in the neck while wearing your snazzy earrings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you’ll use the small hole punch to make holes for the jump rings. I just eyeballed where to punch. You’ll want the holes relatively close to the edge so there’s room to work in the jump ring. If you don’t understand what I mean, you will once you try it. And it’s ok to mess up a few times. (I still do!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/sce-12.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sce-12_thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Punching&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/sce-13.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sce-13_thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Punching&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/sce-14.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sce-14_thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Punching2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is adding some beads. I figured a biggish one or a few small ones would need to be on the bottom to prevent the earring from flapping around too much. I decided to stick to Surge colors for these. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a headpin for the bottom bead. These have a little flat head to keep the bead on. You’ll have to cut off the excess then use the curling tool to make a loop. How much to leave on is also something I eyeball and will still get wrong a lot. So again don’t worry about messing up a few times. When it comes to making the loop that is something you will begin to “feel.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are pins that come with a loop on one side. For my green and red beads I used this, cut off the extra, and made the second loop on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/sce-15.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sce-15_thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beads&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/sce-16.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sce-16_thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beads2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/sce-17.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sce-17_thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beads3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture on the right is the “blueprint” of my earring. Just connect everything together and you’ve got yourself an earring! Make a second one for a pair! What’s cool about the Surge can is that each earring is unique. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Bawls can I have only used the barcode and the inside of the can because I haven’t quite figured out what I want to do with those “eyes.” I want to get some different design hole punches to try out as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not too bad, right? See what you can make! If you do make your own - post a picture. I love seeing how different people come up with different designs and ideas on how to go about doing something. Perhaps you’ve figured out a better way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bye!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Techy Door Wreath</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When my husband and I moved into our apartment here in California I noticed that a few of the other residents had door wreaths, which made me want one. I knew that I needed to make something that both my husband and I would enjoy. I wasn’t going to succumb him to something flowery or otherwise “girly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So of course I went the technology route. I ended up taking apart my DVD player since we have a XBox we can play DVDs in. But that only gave me about 3-4 good pieces to work with. I found it amusing that the word “Play” was misspelled on the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/play.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DVD&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was trying to figure out a way to get a bunch of computer parts for cheap I at least got the wreath itself ready. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Michael’s the craft store I got an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.michaels.com/M10375063.html#q=wreath&amp;amp;start=5&quot;&gt;Ahland Straw Wreath Form&lt;/a&gt; in 12 inches. Then I took a black sparkly ribbon also from Michael’s at 2.5 inches wide and wrapped it around the wreath using needles with heads every so often to keep the ribbon in place.  For hanging the wreath I pinned the two ends of a black ribbon about .5 inches wide into half a loop onto what would be the back of the wreath. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the tech part. Some friends came over and they asked if we had been to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weirdstuff.com&quot;&gt;Weird Stuff&lt;/a&gt; yet. We had not even heard of the place yet. It’s basically a big warehouse full of mainly old computer stuff. Everything from wires to full computers to a bucket of nuts and bolts 50 cents a scoop to all the things I ended up buying for the wreath. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wreath1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Assembly&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I laid everything out on the table that I was planning on using for the wreath. The things from Weird Stuff I got for $20. Not pictured is a keyboard and a couple other small things for future projects. So really, like, $17. Then I placed things on the wreath overlapping like a collage and just seeing how I liked the look of something somewhere and took a picture of that. I took every thing off, plugged in the heat gun, then glued everything into place using the photo as a reference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the end result:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wreath2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Finished&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up using one of those &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.command.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/NACommand/Command/Products/Catalog/~/Command-Designer-Medium-Hooks?N=5924736+3294529207+3294773807&amp;amp;rt=rud&quot;&gt;Command Strips&lt;/a&gt; to hang the wreath on the door. I believe that is the exact kind I bought. The wreath is kind of hefty. We tested the hook with a bag of 10 pound rat food overnight and it held. So even though it says 3 pound weight limit, it’s fine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the hook holds it up well that doesn’t prevent someone from accidentally knocking it down by hitting it with their backpack &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; husband &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;. A few items fell off including two of the projector light bulbs, but thankfully they didn’t break and I was able to just re-glue what fell off back on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there you have it! A Techy Door Wreath! 
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wreath3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Door&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know in the comments if you would like to see more progress pictures. Taking progress pictures is something I’m not used to doing, but I also don’t want to start if people find it annoying. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Twinkle, Twinkle</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, welcome to my blog of things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured as a first blog/test blog I’ll post something I’ve done in the past. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost a year ago I was speaking to my then boyfriend (now husband) about LEDs and making them blink. I looked up at a painting I had done a few years previous of an astronaut floating in space with a quote from one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCOIjvWFFo8&quot;&gt;The Hoosiers&lt;/a&gt; songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked if I could make the stars actually twinkle and he said, “sure!” And so it began…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this was the point in which he had me learn how to solder via a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10547&quot;&gt;SparkFun Simon game&lt;/a&gt;. Then he showed me the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arduino.cc/&quot;&gt;Arduino&lt;/a&gt; software and walked me through how to write a script to make the stars randomly blink at different light levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I got the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adafruit.com/products/1138&quot;&gt;AdaFruit Neopixel LEDs&lt;/a&gt; and tested them along the way. Finally glueing them to the back of the canvas, allowing the light to shine through by poking a hole for each star with a thumbtack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I have the whole thing hooked up to a 12 volt battery, but those are a little expensive and only last about 6 hours total. What I want to do is hook it up to an actual plug and have it on a light sensor to just turn on at night. Or something like that instead of a switch and battery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/twinkle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Front and Back&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
