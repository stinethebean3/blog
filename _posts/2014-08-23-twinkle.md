Hello, welcome to my blog of things. 

I figured as a first blog/test blog I'll post something I've done in the past. 

Almost a year ago I was speaking to my then boyfriend (now husband) about LEDs and making them blink. I looked up at a painting I had done a few years previous of an astronaut floating in space with a quote from one of [The Hoosiers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCOIjvWFFo8) songs.

I asked if I could make the stars actually twinkle and he said, "sure!" And so it began...

I think this was the point in which he had me learn how to solder via a [SparkFun Simon game](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10547). Then he showed me the [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) software and walked me through how to write a script to make the stars randomly blink at different light levels.

Then I got the [AdaFruit Neopixel LEDs](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1138) and tested them along the way. Finally glueing them to the back of the canvas, allowing the light to shine through by poking a hole for each star with a thumbtack. 

Right now I have the whole thing hooked up to a 12 volt battery, but those are a little expensive and only last about 6 hours total. What I want to do is hook it up to an actual plug and have it on a light sensor to just turn on at night. Or something like that instead of a switch and battery.
