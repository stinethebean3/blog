Welcome to 2015! Which everyone knows will be the year of funky fresh fashion according to Back to the Future II, right?

Maybe not, but I recently saw a photo on Pinterest of a pair of earrings fashioned from an Arizona Tea can. The cherry blossom design is quite pretty. But I of course thought to myself, "I can do that."

The only soda cans in my home happen to be Surge and Bawls. The nerdiest, techiest of drinks. 

I got my tools out and started cutting open the cans and cutting out designs using (so far) 2 techniques.
